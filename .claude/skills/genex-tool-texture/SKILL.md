description: Generate a tiling PBR texture set with `npx genex texture` — ground, floors, walls, rock, bark, metal, fabric, any repeating surface. Produces several maps (base colour, normal, roughness and friends) as separate files in ./assets, and `--terrain` makes the result seamless for large ground planes.

# Genex Tools · Texture

A repeating SURFACE, as a set of PBR maps. Use this for anything a material
covers: ground, floors, walls, cliffs, bark, hull plating, cloth.

For a single flat picture — a poster, a sign, a sprite — use `$genex-tool-image`
instead. That is one image; this is a tiling material.

## Run

```bash
npx genex texture "mossy cracked cobblestone"
npx genex texture "dry cracked riverbed clay" --terrain    # seamless, for ground planes
```

Saves EVERY map into `./assets` as its own file, one line each, labelled by role:

```
✓ Done — 3 files saved to your project:
  assets/mossy-cracked-cobblestone-a1b2c3d4-basecolor.png  (2.1 MB)
  assets/mossy-cracked-cobblestone-a1b2c3d4-normal.png     (1.8 MB)
  assets/mossy-cracked-cobblestone-a1b2c3d4-roughness.png  (900 KB)
```

Load each map into the matching material slot and set the wrapping mode to
repeat — the file names carry the role, so the mapping is unambiguous.

## Options

- `--terrain` — a seamless tiling surface, for ground and large planes. Use it whenever the texture repeats across something big.
- `--out-dir <dir>` — where the files land (default `./assets`).
- `--no-download` — print the URLs only.
- `--no-wait` — enqueue and return; pick it up with `npx genex wait <id>`.

## Cost

From **9 credits** for the whole set (1 credit = $0.01). Live prices and
your balance: `npx genex doctor`.

## Waiting

`--no-wait` returns an id; `npx genex wait <id>` picks it up and never bills.
**Re-running the texture command bills a NEW set.**

## Troubleshooting

- **The surface shows a visible repeating grid** — the CLI measures the seam automatically and warns when it is bad. Re-generate with `--terrain`, or scale the repeat down so the tile is smaller on screen. A repeating grid across a floor is the single most visible "asset flip" tell there is, so treat that warning as work.
- **Out of credits** — the error prints balance, price and refill date. Relay it; don't retry.
- **Anything else** — `npx genex doctor`.
